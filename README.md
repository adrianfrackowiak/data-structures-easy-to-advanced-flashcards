## Abstract Data Types

1. ### What is a Data Structure?

   A **data structure (DS)** is a way of organising data so that it can be used effectively.

2. ### Why Data Structures?

   - They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.
   - They help to manage and organise data.
   - They make code cleaner and easier to understand.

3. ### What is An Abstract Data Type?

   An **abstract data type (ADT)** is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.

   The interface does not give any specific detail about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.

4. ### Abstraction (ADT) vs Implementation (DS)
   | Abstraction (ADT) | Implementation (DS)                                               |
   | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | List              | Dynamic Array<br>Linked List                                      |
   | Queue             | Linked List based Queue<br>Array based Queue<br>Stack based Queue |
   | Map               | Tree Map<br>Hash Map / Hash Table                                 |
   | Vehicle           | Golf Cart<br>Bicycle<br>Smart Car                                 |
